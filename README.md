# Flashcards API
React Native Project — Udacity React Developer Nanodegree

This is the backend for [Flashcards](https://github.com/MarcCollado/flashcards), the third (and last) project of the [React Developer Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019). Below you'll find the rest of the Nanodegree projects and I also wrote a [short post](https://www.collado.io/blog/2018/udacity-rdnd) in my blog about the course experience.
